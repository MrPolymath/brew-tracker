## Features:

- Repeat my brew
- Recipes ? --> You can save a brew as a receipe and then other people can repeate it
- Tracking of many aspects of the resulting brew
- Chronometer ? --> Maybe the time of the brew should be tracked in here
- Steps of the brew ? --> Problem is that each method might have different types of steps

### Time

Not sure how to do that. There's probably different steps involved, so time is not a total but rather an accumulation of different times.

### Smell

- Intensity (how strong does it smell)
- Quality (how good does it smell)
- Aroma (what does it smell like? not required)

### Acidity

(loved by coffee professionals. Felt in the bottom side of the tongue. It leaves you with a feeling of needing to salivate. - Intensity (numeric value)

### Sweetness

(hard. Numeric) - Intensity

### Bitterness

(numeric. In theory, a failure) - Intensity

### Body

(texture? mouth feel?)

### Finish

(what are you left with after you drink it? harshness? pleasant developing flavours? bad taste? good taste? aftertaste. Some coffees disappear fast, others stay for a long time)

### Flavour

- Fruity - Fresh fruits (berries, apples) —> Very tied to acidity
- Can cooked (jammy, baked)
- Tropical (fermented flavours)
- Caramelisation (come from roasting)
- Toast, biscuit, caramel…
- Unpleasant:
  - Earth? Wood? Mushrooms? Vinegar?

### Score
